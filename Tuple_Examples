#Tuple_examples


# Define a tuple with mixed data types
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, "hello", True)

# Print the entire tuple
print(my_tuple)

# Access and print the 3rd element (index 2)
print(my_tuple[2])

# Print all elements starting from index 2 onwards
print(my_tuple[2:])

# Print the entire tuple using slice
print(my_tuple[:])

# Print the first 3 elements of the tuple
print(my_tuple[:3])

# Iterate over the tuple and print each element
for i in my_tuple:
    print(i)

# Check if "hello" is present in the tuple and print a message
if "hello" in my_tuple:
    print("---------------------------Present")

# Convert the tuple into a list
my_tuple1 = list(my_tuple)

# Append a new element multiple times into the list
for i in my_tuple1:
    my_tuple1.append("hekhfda")
    # The commented line "print(i)" would print the element in the iteration, but it is commented out.

# Print the modified list (with repeated "hekhfda" values)
print(my_tuple1)
